🔗 Dataset URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv

🧬 Feature Description:
1. Pregnancies               → Number of times the patient was pregnant
2. Glucose                   → Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
3. BloodPressure             → Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness             → Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin                   → 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI                       → Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction → A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
8. Age                       → Age in years
9. Outcome                   → Class label (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

📌 Notes:
- Some features (e.g., Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin) contain biologically impossible zero values.
- These zeroes were treated as missing values and imputed using column mean.
- Dataset is often used for binary classification problems in health analytics.
