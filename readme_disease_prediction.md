# CodeAlpha\_DiseasePredictionModel

## 🚀 Project Title

**Disease Prediction using Machine Learning (Diabetes Dataset)**

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a classification model that predicts whether an individual has diabetes based on various medical and physiological features. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for health diagnostics and risk assessment.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv)

- **Features:**

  - `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
  - `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
  - `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
  - `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
  - `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
  - `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
  - `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes likelihood based on family history
  - `Age`: Age in years
  - `Outcome`: (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

- **Note:** Some features contain 0s which are treated as missing values and replaced with the column mean.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, Logistic Regression, Evaluation Metrics)

---

## 🧪 ML Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Loaded dataset from public GitHub source.
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Replaced biologically invalid 0s with NaN.
   - Filled missing values with column means.
   - Standardized the features.
3. **Model Training:** Used Random Forest Classifier.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Classification Report
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - Feature Importance
